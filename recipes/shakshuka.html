            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato puree or sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 pinch Aleppo chili flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>sliced bread to serve alongside</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a small pan or skillet. </li>
            <li> Place mushrooms in a single layer in the skillet, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Top with onions, then peppers, and another pinch of salt. </li>
            <li> Place on medium high heat, and wait for mushrooms to start sizzling. Cook until bottoms of mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes, and then stir everything together and cook for 1 minute more.  </li>
            <li> Add cumin, paprika, turmeric, oregano, black pepper, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for another 30 to 60 seconds. Stir in tomato puree and water, and wait for mixture to simmer. Stir in cilantro, and scatter over half the feta. </li>
            <li> Use a spoon to make a well in the center, and transfer in the egg. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook until the egg is done to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Serve immediately topped with Aleppo chili flakes, and the remaining olive oil, feta, and cilantro, with bread on the side. </li>
        </ol>
